Lookit that, I'm making ANOTHER portfolio!

**NOTE - BEFORE RUNNING, MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL PACKAGES WITH YARN**

## TO-DO

- Reactive ~~
  - About height is non-effective in some cases
  - Phones have slight overflow issues
- Scrolling anywhere on the page causes the show-nav to fire (at lower reactive levels)
  - This can probably be fixed by just adjusting the overflow for the entire page.

## Ideas

- Projects Section - Separate them out into two categories?

  - Projects I've contributed to
  - Projects I've created

- Projects Section - Include what I contributed to the projects, along with a quick tl;dr similar to what would be included in a resume.
