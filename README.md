**NOTE - BEFORE RUNNING, MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL PACKAGES WITH YARN**

## Known Issues

- Scrolling on the homepage will cause it to display the sidebar
- Reactivity in the projects section causes issues at viewports lower than 1920x1080 or at a different aspect ratio.
- Missing Contact & Life sections, will need to revamp these in the future.

## TO-DO

- Reactive ~~
  - About height is non-effective in some cases
  - Phones have slight overflow issues
- Scrolling anywhere on the page causes the show-nav to fire (at lower reactive levels)
  - This can probably be fixed by just adjusting the overflow for the entire page.
- LESS needs to be broken down into multiple files and imported properly.
- Uneven numbers of projects will break the formatting in the projects section.
- Set-up contact segment
- Set-up or remove "Life" segment.
- Add a section for work history ~ maybe something akin to a half-resume?
- Add a section for Languages/Frameworks
- Adjust background-images to be faster loading (smaller file size).

## Ideas

- Projects Section - Separate them out into two categories?
  - Projects I've contributed to
  - Projects I've created
- Projects Section - Include what I contributed to the projects, along with a quick tl;dr similar to what would be included in a resume.
- Projects section needs to be more fluid, possibly smaller project buttons? Less padding obviously, resize should be fluid at every viewport.
